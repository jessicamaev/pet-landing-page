SheCodes Pet Landing Page Challenge: Create a new landing page about a beloved animal companion!

📖 Challenge Instructions
This coding challenge is for all the animal lovers out there! We ask you to code your own landing page to tell us all about your pet or pet you'd love to own!

Make sure to include different elements on your page (e.g. text, buttons, links, prompts). Also, include content about your pet to make sure your submission stands out! You can include anything you like about your pet: their story, your favorite things about them - let your creativity run wild! We want you to have as much freedom as you need, so don't hesitate to try interesting techniques and show your personality in your code. 

👩‍💻 Entry Requirements
Please make sure that you:
- Submit a valid and single HTML file, including the content related to the challenge theme. The HTML file must contain your HTML code, CSS code, and, optionally, JavaScript code. It's only possible to submit one HTML file, so multi-page websites are not admittable.
- Upload all of your images with the SheCodes Uploader (it will create a link for you to include your images in your code):
